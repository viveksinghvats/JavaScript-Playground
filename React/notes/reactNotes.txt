1. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json: Lock file have the exact versions of dependencies, while package.json have '~' and '^' because of this will have tentative versions in the file.
2. npm vs npx: npm is used to install or update packages, while npx is used for exectuing a package
3. JSX is HTML like syntax not html.
4. JSX is used to create React.element => React.createElement(tag, attribute, childeren/body);
5. JSX is not pure javaScript, Babel takes JSX and convert it to JS code before it reaches the JS engine.
6. Attributes passed in JSX for a tag will follow camelCase.
7. Functional Component should always be Uppercase. Functional Component is nothing but a function which returns JSX.
8. We can write javaScript code in JSX using {js code}.
9. We use props to pass data into functional components. It's just like passing arguments to the functions.
10: Keys are important while rendering children, keys should be unique among the siblings, not passing the key will force the react to re-render everything after a sibling changes.
11. using Index as keys are bad practice => (No Keys <<< Index as keys <<<<<<<<<< Unique key) among the siblings.
12. Two types of exports => 1. export defult Component(defult) 2. export Component (Named export).
13. React Hooks are noraml utility JS function.(useState, useEffect). 
14. React uses Reconcilliation Algorithm (React fiber).
15. Virtual Dom is representation of Actual Dom. Virtual Dom is just a JS object(React.element(object));
16: const [list, setList] = useState(initialData). Here setList is a callback function which works as trigger to update the virtual Dom, when state change happen.
17. If we have to do something, after UI is rendered we use useEffect. useEffect is called after the component rendered.
18. useEffect is called on every render. but if dependency array is empty, it will call only one time, or if dependency mentioned, then it will be called when dependency changes.
19. While moving to a different page through a link never use anchor tag, use Link component provided by react-router-dom, Link don't reload the whole page, while anchor does.
